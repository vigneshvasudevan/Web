Flex Container properties:

It can be broadly be classified into properties which works on 
    1. main axis
    2. cross axis
 

properties which works on main-axis:
    1. Flex-direction
        default value : row
        row: Items will be arranged L->R
        row-reverse :  Items will be arranged R->L
        column:Items will be arranged Top -> Bottom
        column-reverse :Items will be arranged Bottom -> Top

    2. Justify-Content
        default value : flex-start
        flex-start : flex items is justified to the main axis flex-start
        flex-end : flex items is justified to the main axis flex-end
        center : flex items is justified to the main axis center
        space-between : Leave equal space b/w item on the main axis
        space around : Leave equal space around the item on the main axis
        equal-space : Leave equal space b/w flex items and around the flex item

properties which works on cross-axis:
    1. Flex wrap: 
        default value: no-wrap
        no-wrap: flex items will be single row(if main axis is row)/ single column (if main axis is column)
        wrap: The flex items break into multiple lines if needed from cross-start to cross end
        wrap-reverse: The flex items break into multiple lines if needed from cross-end to cross start

    2. Align-Items:
        default value: flex-start stretch
        flex-start : flex items is justified to the cross axis flex-start
        flex-end : flex items is justified to the cross axis axis flex-end
        center : flex items is justified to the cross axis center
        no-stretch : take only required width/height
        stretch : to stretch item on the cross-axis
        baseline : value will align flex items along their content's baseline


    3. Align-Content: works only for flex container having multi-line in other words when flex-wrap:wrap or wrap-reverse
        This value determines where next line goes to. 
        
        default value: start
        start : Pack items from the start
        end : Pack items from the end 



Note: position : absolute/relative/fixed/sticky will still work at flex-items
